# Analysis-of-shear-strength-of-weld-bonded-lap-joints
 In terms of mechanical fastening, bonding of metals is increasingly important.The
 joint between metals can be temporary and it can be permanent.With respect to
 permanent joints, welding and riveting comes first in mind.For lap joints we can do
 resistance spot welding.In automotive industry some parts of vehicle joins together
 with resistance spot welding.Besides resistance spot welding, Adhesive bonding has
 its own importance.The applications of adhesive bonding are found in the assembly
 of many products like aircrafts, cars, trucks and office furniture.In electrical and
 electronic industry, adhesives are used in variety of ways.Due to uniform distribution
 of stresses, adhesive bonding makes life easier.But what if materials joined by both
 methods of joining i.e, resistance spot welding and adhesive bonding?So such joining
 technique is known as weld bonding.We will discuss types of weld bonding(In flow
 and Weld through techniques) and our study will be on weld through technique.
 So in our project our main goal will be to analyze the tensile shear strength of singly
 weld bonded lap joints of mild steel(made from weld through technique) and
 compare tensile shear strength with resistance spot welded lap joints and adhesive
 bonded lap joints.In our study we will compare the bond strength among three
 techniques that are Resistance spot welding, adhesive bonding and weld
 bonding.Also varying different process parameters will result in different strength
 of weld joints.
